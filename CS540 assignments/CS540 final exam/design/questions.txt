Q1 is only about API, no implementation. So like a reference manual for users (except much shorter than a real container).

Total length of this should be no more than the equivalent of about 1 page.

==================================================================================================

Question 1
----------

Design the *public* API for a List container. The container should
allow:

1. Iterating through it.
2. Inserting at any position, including beginning, end, and before any element.
3. Removal of an element in O(1) time.

You'll need to think a little bit about how to identify to the
container which element to remove.  The container should allow
duplicated elements.  The container imposes no requirements on the
contained type other than a copy constructor and destructor.

Iterators should not be invalidated after mutation of the list.

Given the API as C code below.

Question 2
----------
Identify what tests you need to validate your List container.  Write
below, just using English is fine, no need for code.

Question 3
----------
What atomic operations or locks would you need for your String
class?  Write English below, no need for code.
